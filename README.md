# Test-Case-Generator
An Object Oriented Algorithms Implementation and Analysis Course Project that generates randomized test cases and output files.

TCG is a simple command based test case generator that can be used to create test cases in multiple numbers and generate output files for the same test cases using their solution code.

Installation of the application once it has been cloned:
```
$ make
```

Once the process is completed, you can run the application using:
```
$ ./TCG
```

To view the manual, you can use the command 'manual' in the application, or open it with:
```
$ gedit manual.txt
```
