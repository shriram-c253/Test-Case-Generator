# Test-Case-Generator
An Object Oriented Algorithms Implementation and Analysis Course Project that generates randomized test cases and output files.

TCG is a simple command based test case generator that can be used to create test cases in multiple numbers and generate output files for the same test cases using their solution code.

Compilation of the application once it has been cloned:
```
$ make
```
Recompilation:
```
$ make clean && make
```

To run the application after compilation:
```
$ ./TCG
```

To view the manual, you can use the command 'manual' in the application, or open it with:
```
$ gedit manual.txt
```
TCG works only on Linux and OS machines, and does not have Windows support.
